## Images in Markdown

The files for displaying images in markdown inside Neovim were taken form the blog of @linkarzu [View and paste images in neovim
](https://linkarzu.medium.com/view-and-paste-images-in-neovim-b7a1a5f0b5a7)

- the final setup taken from the [Unlock visuals in Neovim Viewing Images Made Easy](https://medium.com/indian-coder/unlock-visuals-in-neovim-viewing-images-made-easy-7753848e26e8)
